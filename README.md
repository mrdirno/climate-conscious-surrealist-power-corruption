### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a 'green' tech CEO must give a tour of a 'Glimmer-crop' field to a group of terrified, yet financially beholden, farmers.
- Draft the internal PR memo from the 'Heartland Harmony' campaign, spinning the glowing, pulsating crops as a feature, not a bug.
- Create a monologue from the character of Emil Voss, explaining the concept of 'chemical memory' to a board of skeptical executives over a dinner of pre-industrial glacier ice.
- Write a surrealist vignette from the perspective of the 'dreaming' synthetic topsoil itself, experiencing the memories of pollution it contains.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative data-visualization interface for Mara's data-slate, showing the 'sickle-moon' profit graph layered with real-time ecological feedback from the Glimmer-crops.
- Conceptualize the architecture and interactive exhibits of the 'Carbon Museum,' where personal guilt is transformed into abstract, beautiful light shows.
